# INDE 577: Data Science & Machine Learning

This repository hosts code for a data science and machine learning course. Concepts are illustrated in Jupyter notebooks applying relevant algorithms on a dataset. The algorithms include both supervised methods for classification and regression, as well as unsupervised learning methods.

## Contents

The algorithms enumerated below are each organized into their own subdirectory containing a `README.md` explanation of relevant background and a `.ipynb` Jupyter notebook of code. To learn more about each algorithm and see them in application, visit their respective linked subdirectories.

## Data
The datasets used are located in the [**Data**](https://github.com/kary5678/INDE-577/tree/main/Data) directory. The main dataset used is the Hawks dataset, which contains observations of three different hawk species and associated features such as wing length, tail length, body weight, etc. 

Please visit the directory for detailed descriptions about the data and appropriate visualizations.
