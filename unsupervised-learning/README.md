# Unsupervised Learning

In unsupervised learning, we do not have any labels for the data unlike in supervised learning. Consequentially, theres no way to measure success in terms of classification error or mean squared error. Instead, heuristics are used in unsupervised learning tasks.


This directory consists of unsupervised learning algorithms, specifically:

### Clustering
* *k*-means clustering
* DBSCAN


### Dimensionality Reduction
